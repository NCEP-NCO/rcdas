C ABSTRACT: EBU3 CONTAINS THE PRIMARY RUNSTREAM FOR THE EARLY ETA
C   FORECAST MODEL.  AFTER AN INITIAL CALL TO SUBROUTINE INIT, CALLS
C   ARE MADE TO SUBROUTINES WHICH COMPUTE THE VARIOUS DYNAMICAL AND
C   PHYSICAL PROCESSES IN THE MODEL.  THE VARIABLE 'NTSD' IS THE
C   FUNDAMENTAL TIMESTEP COUNTER AND THUS ITS VALUE DETERMINES WHEN
C   THE SUBROUTINES ARE CALLED.  INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE SCHEMES
C   USED IN THE MODEL AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL REFERENCES MAY BE FOUND
C   IN "THE STEP-MOUNTAIN ETA COORDINATE REGIONAL MODEL:  A DOCUMEN-
C   TATION" (BLACK 1988; DEVELOPMENT DIVISION) AND "THE NEW NMC MESO-
C   SCALE ETA MODEL:  DESCRIPTION AND FORECAST EXAMPLES (BLACK 1994;
C   WEATHER AND FORECASTING).
