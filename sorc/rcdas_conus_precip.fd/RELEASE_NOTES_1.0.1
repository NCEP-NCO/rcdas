v1.0.1

code moved from precforce.f.v1.0.0 -> precforcev2.f	
  many changes to code
  1) replaced f95 where (condition) statement with f90 code
       not handled correctly by intel fortran compiler 
       result: cpc daily gauge was replaced by NDAS (wrong)
  2) change in scaling of cpc-daily-gauge - not noticed because
     NDAS was being used.  This scaling factor was most likely
     the result of replacing the original cpc gauge dataset (Fang Yin)
     with a new dataset (PingPing Xie).
  3) for 1 case, nearest neighbor (with precip) was replace by
     a weighted box average. Original code was too hairy to follow.
  4) for 2nd case, neareset neighbor code was rewritten as wasn't
     sure the original code was correct and could seg fault.
