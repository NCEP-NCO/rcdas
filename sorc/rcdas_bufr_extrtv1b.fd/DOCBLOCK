c main program: EXTRTV1B     time-windows and dupl-checks tovs1b data

c abstract: reads in time-windowing specifications and list of tovs1b 
c   orbital files from standard input.  the tovs1b reports are then
c   read in from their separate files and checked against the time
c   window.  reports which satisfy the time window are checked for 
c   duplicates and written out to the dump file.

c usage:
c
c   input files:
c     unit 05  - standard input : namelist contains number of input 
c                files, satellite id, time-windowing specifications, 
c                line and spot sampling factors and the output file.
c                a list of tovs1b input orbital files follows the 
c                end of the namelist.
c     unit 11  - binary tovs1b orbital files
c
c   output files:
c     unit 06  - printout
c     unit 51  - binary tovs1b dump file
