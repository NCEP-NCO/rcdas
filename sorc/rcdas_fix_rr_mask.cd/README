Program:  fix_rr_mask
  Programmer: Wesley Ebisuzaki

Abstract:
  The narr (eta) product generator converts grib data on the model grid (egrid) to the
Lambert conformal (AWIPS grid 221) grid.  A problem with the product generator allows
some AWIPS grid points at the edge of the domain to be created from data that depends on
the model's boundary conditions (i.e. not part of the computational domain).  Since
the boundary conditions are "artificial", they should not be used in generating the
analyses.  Consequently this program (fix_rr_mask) was written to mask out the points
that were generated using the boundary points.
