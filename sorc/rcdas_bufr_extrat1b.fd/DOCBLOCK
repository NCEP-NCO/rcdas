c abstract: reads in time-windowing specifications and list of noaa-15 
c   1b orbital files from standard input.  the 1b reports are then
c   read in from their separate files and checked against the time
c   window.  reports which satisfy the time window are checked for 
c   duplicates and written out to the dump file.
