Program:  narr_fix_rr_conv
  Programmer: Wesley Ebisuzaki

Abstract:
  The narr generated water vapor and cloud water flux convergences.  However, the
convergences values were not scaled by 1/grid-length.  This program reads (1) a grib
table with all the grid lengths, (2) a grid 221 grib file and scales the moisture 
flux convergences and outputs a new grid 221 grib file.
