C MAIN PROGRAM: EDITBUFR     EDIT BUFR BY GRID
C   PRGMMR: K. BRILL         ORG: NP22        DATE: 1998-11
C
C ABSTRACT: 
C
C  EDITBUFR WILL RETAIN DATA LOCATED IN RETENTION GRID DEFINED
C  FROM STANDARD INPUT. THE FORMAT OF THE PARAMETER
C  LIST IS AS FOLLOWS:
C
C  FIRST WE READ THE GRID NUMBER THAT DEFINES THE RETENTION AREA
C
C  GRID#     - IS THE NUMBER OF THE RETENTION GRID
C
C  THEN WE READ THE DATE INFORMATION
C
C  YYMMDD    - IS THE (TWO-DIGIT) YEAR, MONTH, AND DAY TO BE KEPT
C              IF YYMMDD IS ZERO, THEN NO DATE CHECK IS PERFORMED
C              IF YYMMDD IS LESS THAN ZERO, THEN ITS MAGNITUDE IS
C              USED AS A LIMIT FOR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE OBSERVATION'S
C              DHR - WHICH IS THE TIME DIFFERENCE IN HUNDREDTH'S OF
C              AN HOUR BETWEEN THE OB TIME AND THE ANALYSIS TIME
C
C  THEN WE READ UP TO 30 DATATYPEs
C
C  DATATYPE  - IS THE OI REPORT TYPE (I.E. 120 IS A RAWINSONDE).
C              IT IS POSSIBLE TO SPECIFY A RANGE OF DATA TYPES
C              BY GIVING AN ABBREVIATED FORM. THAT IS, TO SPECIFY
C              TYPES 120 THROUGH 129, THE PARAMETER IS '12'. TYPES
C              100 THROUGH 199 WOULD BE SPECIFIED BY '1'. AND SO ON.
C
C
C  THE INPUT  PREPBUFR FILE IS ASSIGNED TO UNIT 20
C  THE OUTPUT PREPBUFR FILE IS ASSIGNED TO UNIT 51
