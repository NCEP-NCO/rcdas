!ABSTRACT: 
!   Disaggregates us_mex precip using hourly weights from CMORPH.
!
!   The us_mex precip data is a daily average that we want to convert to
!hourly values.  Use hourly CMORPH data to calculate time weights.
!
!            :(1)  IF CMORPH_SUM=0.0 BUT US_MEX P > 0 THEN
!            : WE ATTEMPT TO CALCULATE THE HOURLY WEIGHTS BY
!            : AVERAGING THE SURROUNDING WEIGHTS
!            :(2) IF WE HAVE UNDEFINED CMORPH VALUES THEN
!            : WE ASSUME EQUAL WEIGHTS OF 1/24 FOR EACH HOUR
