narr_fix_rr1

The NARR (ETA/NAM) GRIB files used non-standard GRIB conventions.  Rather
than setting values to undefined (using the undefined bitmap, BMS), they set 
values to some "unrealistic" values.  For NARR, we needed to set the undefined
values to the GRIB standard undefined.  

fix_rr1 uses the land-sea mask to maskout certain land-only quantities and other
logic to cloud free regions, etc.
